## Welcome to my React Markdown Previewer

I made this Markdown Previewer with React as [project #2](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-markdown-previewer) of the Front End Libraries, part of the [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) curriculum.

##### To do list
I am happy with the final(?) result, but a small to-do list for the future:
- _Place the "default text"/"initial state" in a separate file to make the App.js file 50 lines shorter._
- _Convert the React class-based component to a functional one like [this](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/react-converting-to-a-hook)._
- _Refactor all the files with more components in the render methods and less written out JS like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fF9vrZNSQC4)._

###### Reasons for suggested changes later on
It would make the app more similar to real-life simulations, using the latest technologies. The reason for not doing it right away is that I spend quite some time on the current app, and the curriculum of FCC focuses on Class-Based instead of Functional.
So it is better to get very well acquainted with Class-Based before changing it again.

And overall: I am very pleased with the project I build, and it is **the first React app created in Visual Studio Code and pushed to Github!**
